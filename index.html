            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img class="me" src="img/me.jpg" alt="Image of me in my office" />
            <p>I grew up knowing virtualy nothing about computers, I tried a coding class in high school and found it interesting but it never really stuck. Fast forward 6 years later I enrolled in a Data Analytics course, and found it to be very mind numbing. However, after learning Python and SQL I realized how much I was starting to enjoy coding. I am now on my 4th semester of the Web Development and Design course and have found this to be very fun and enjoyable. My goal once I graduate would be to work somewhere part-time as either a front end or back end developer, working on broadening my experience and knowledge, and eventually transition into full time work or even freelance. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am a full-time employee, I currently work in production scheduling but have background experience in manufacturing roles and supply chain logistics. Outside of work I own a house with my fiance, and we have four dogs and two cats. When I have free time I enjoy reading or drawing, we also have motorcycles we like to get out on when the weather is nice.</p>
